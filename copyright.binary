Comment:
 This file contains the copyright status of the files in the Windows binary
 distribution (i.e. the copyright NetHack 4 has after being built). For other
 operating systems, the copyright works the same way but some of the filenames
 may be different.

 These tilesets were made by Alex Smith by combining tiles from
 DawnHack (under CC-BY-3.0) and DawnLike (under CC-BY-SA-3.0), both
 from the same artist, Andrew Rios. (The organization of the tiles,
 i.e. the choice of which image from DawnHack and/or DawnLike to use
 for each tile, was done by Alex Smith.) DawnLike's copyright
 information is as follows:
 .
 Dawnlike is registered under a CC-BY-SA 3.0 license, meaning that you
 are free to redistribute or edit any part of this tileset as long as
 you do not take the credit for it. I cannot stop you from using this
 tileset commercially, so feel free to sell any games using Dawnlike.
 .
 If you use this tileset you must accredit DawnBringer. That mad
 color-bending genius came up with the palette this entire pack lives
 on. Without his palette, I would probably never would have even
 finished DawnHack. As for crediting me, I have a unique
 request. Inside "Reptiles.png" you will find a Platino sprite. If you
 use Dawnlike, you MUST use this sprite and hide him very well!
Comment:
 Because these tiles only specify artwork and are entirely independent
 of NetHack itself (acting as data files communicating over a well
 defined API), there's no need for the license to be "combinable" with
 that of NetHack 4 as a whole.

License: NGPL
Copyright: These tiles were copied from an NGPL Slash'EM release that was
 Copyright (C) J. Ali Harlow 2000-2006, which gives the following
 explanation of the provenance and copyright status of the tiles:
 .
 Window ports can optionally make use of the tiles (pictures for NetHack
 symbols) found in this directory.  They are distributed in a text format
 with routines to help in converting them to a system's preferred format
 and using them there.  The original tiles were provided by Warwick Allison.
 .
 The 32x32 tileset stored in mon32mi.txt, obj32mi.txt and oth32mi.txt and the
 Psuedo-3D tileset stored in mon3dmi.txt, obj3dmi.txt and oth3dmi.txt were
 created by a number of different people under the direction of Mitsuhiro
 Itakura (ita@gold.koma.jaeri.go.jp) who also holds the copyright on these
 tiles.  The artists were:
 .
         Mitsuhiro Itakura
         Haruko Numata
         Edger
         ZMYDaino
         Wan'ichi
         Tatsuya
 .
 The 32x32 tileset stored in mon32alg.txt, obj32alg.txt and oth32alg.txt
 and the additional tiles stored in xxx32al2.txt (not used by all ports)
 were imported from AllegroHack, written by Kelly Youngblood (jry@pinn.net).
 The artists were:
 .
         Kelly Youngblood
         Paul Pliska
         John Harris
 .
 The 32x32 tileset stored in mon32aw.txt was contributed by Andrew Walker.
 .
 Slash'EM specific high resolution tiles are stored in mon32se.txt, obj32se.txt
 and oth32se.txt. These override those found in other tilesets.
 Tiles which are not present in any other set are created from the 16x16 tiles.
 .
 A very few individual tiles in these tile images come from NetHack 3.4.3 or
 were made specifically for NetHack 4 by Alex Smith.

Comment:
 rltiles-attribution and NGPL are compatible; rltiles-attribution's
 requirements are a) that you preserve the copyright notice, and b) that
 you mention who (if anyone) modified the tiles, both subsets of NGPL
 requirements (and thus the resulting terms are identical to those of
 the NGPL).
Copyright:
 This file contains tile images, together with a description of which
 image should be used for what purpose within the game (the tile
 organization). The tile organization was designed by Raz, and coded
 by Alex Smith. The graphical tile images have the following

 Part of (or All) the graphic tiles used in this program is the public
 domain roguelike tileset "RLTiles".
 Some of the tiles have been modified by Raz.

                     NETHACK GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                     (Copyright 1989 M. Stephenson)
 .
                (Based on the BISON general public license,
                    copyright 1988 Richard M. Stallman)
 .
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
  license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also use this wording to
  make the terms for other programs.
 .
   The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of
 those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is intended to give
 everyone the right to share NetHack.  To make sure that you get the rights we
 want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you
 these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  Hence this license
 agreement.
 .
   Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
 copies of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you
 want it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free
 programs, and that you know you can do these things.
 .
   To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
 deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute copies
 of NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You
 must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you
 must tell them their rights.
 .
   Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out
 that there is no warranty for NetHack.  If NetHack is modified by someone
 else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is
 not what we distributed.
 .
   Therefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make
 the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or
 change NetHack.
 .
 .
                         COPYING POLICIES
 .
   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as
 you receive it, in any medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on
 all files that refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the
 absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack
 program a copy of this License Agreement along with the program.
 .
   2. You may modify your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and
 copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above
 (including distributing this License Agreement), provided that you also do the
 following:
 .
     a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
     changed the files and the date of any change; and
 .
     b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in
     whole or in part contains or is a derivative of NetHack or any part
     thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms
     identical to those contained in this License Agreement (except that you
     may choose to grant more extensive warranty protection to some or all
     third parties, at your option)
 .
     c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
     transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection
     in exchange for a fee.
 .
   3. You may copy and distribute NetHack (or a portion or derivative of it,
 under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
 Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 .
     a) accompany it with the complete machine-readable source code, which
     must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,
 .
     b) accompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete
     machine-readable source code from an appropriate archive site.  (This
     alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution.)
 .
 For these purposes, complete source code means either the full source
 distribution as originally released over Usenet or updated copies of the
 files in this distribution used to create the object code or executable.
 .
   4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack except as
 expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt otherwise to
 copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack is void and your rights to
 use the program under this License agreement shall be automatically
 terminated.  However, parties who have received computer software programs
 from you with this License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated
 so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 .
 Stated plainly:  You are permitted to modify NetHack, or otherwise use parts
 of NetHack, provided that you comply with the conditions specified above;
 in particular, your modified NetHack or program containing parts of NetHack
 must remain freely available as provided in this License Agreement.  In
 other words, go ahead and share NetHack, but don't try to stop anyone else
 from sharing it farther.
