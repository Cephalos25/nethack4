! This text tileset lists the special rules for the Rogue level.

! Note: this is copying base tiles, not substitution tiles...
sub rogue *: gray bgblack regular basechar

! ...so we need to redo the furthest backgrounds...
sub rogue the floor of a room: gray bgblack regular '.'
sub rogue sub unlit the floor of a room: gray bgblack regular '.'
sub rogue corridor: gray bgblack regular '#'
sub rogue sub lit corridor: gray bgblack regular '#'

! ...and statues and corpses.
sub rogue sub corpse *: ':'
sub rogue sub statue *: '`'

! Rogue used different backgrounds to ASCII NetHack in some cases, and
! to Unicode NetHack in many more cases.

sub rogue walls 1: '-'
sub rogue walls 2: '-'
sub rogue walls 3: '-'
sub rogue walls 4: '-'
sub rogue walls 5: '-'

sub rogue walls 7: '-'
sub rogue walls 8: '-'
sub rogue walls 9: '|'
sub rogue walls 10: '|'
sub rogue open doors ?: '+'
sub rogue doorway: '+'
sub rogue *staircase *: '%'

! Even for things that weren't in Rogue, Unicode looks weird.

sub rogue iron bars: '#'
sub rogue fountain: '{'
sub rogue altar: '_'
sub rogue ice: '.'
sub rogue water; sub rogue underwater; sub rogue lava: '}'
