This is a chart of all the places in the source distribution that need
to be updated due to a new version of NetHack coming out (i.e. a "if
you produced a new version, what's the minimum that has to change?"):

  * aimake.rules ($version constant near the start of the file)
  * libnethack/include/patchlevel.h (VERSION_COMPATIBILITY constant,
    if and only if the new release breaks save compatibility)
  * libnethack/dat/history (first line)
  * dist/debian/changelog (summary changelog entry for Debian)
  * doc/changelog.txt (detailed description of the changes)
  * libnethack_common/include/nethack.h (this is the central place
    from which most code should be pulling the version number)
  * README (describe the new version)
  * scripts/build-debian-package, scripts/build-windows-zipfile
    (filename of the newly created package)

Additionally, almost every release will change the copyright status
(typically just dates, but perhaps more extensively):

  * copyright, copyright.binary
  * aimake.rules ($copyright statement)
  * libnethack/include/patchlevel.h (this is the central place from
    which most code should be pulling the copyright statement)

Places to announce a new release (including betas):

  * http://reddit.com/r/nethack
  * IRC channels on Freenode: #nethack (just say it's been released),
    #nethack4 (change the topic if necessary)
  * rec.games.roguelikes.nethack on Usenet
  * the networkmotd daemon on http://motd.nethack4.org (needs an admin
    to change this)

Note that the NGPL also requires all modified files to specify who
modified them and when, which is a pretty obnoxious requirement.
Nowadays, we get git to do this automatically: see
scripts/vcs-hooks/git-hooks-post-commit.
